# spring-data-jpa-simple-app
This is a simple app demonstrating how to use **Spring Data JPA framework** for creation of a relational database and for manupilation of data on it. 

In this app we learnt how to create methods for writing/reading data from Db. 

Using Spring Data JPA Framework -which is a **declarative framework**- operations on db are easier to formulate and there is no need to write complex sql statements. In addition, we can switch
from one rdbms to another one very easily.

We used **Lombok** for fast creation of getters, setters, and constructors.
We tested our code on **H2 in-memory RDMS** and then switched to **mysql**.
